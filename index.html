            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Selah Bellscheidt. I am a masters in computer science student at Western Washington University. 
              My research area is digital accessibility, specifically focused on investigating the use of persuasive design to encourage alternative text authoring, 
              as well as methods for integrating accessibility knowledge into computer science curriculum.  
            </p>
             <p>
              I graduated with my undergraduate degree from Western Washington University in 2022 with a double major of computer science and English literature.  
               In my perfect world, I would always have a good book to read and a puzzle to crack.
              I am passionate about the importance of making digital technology and computer science education accessible and equitable for all!

            <h3>Investigating Triggers to Encourage Alt Text Authoring Behavior Change</h3>
            <p> Project Advisor: Dr. Yasmine Elglaly </p>
            <p> Project Teammates: Thuan Nguyen, Binh Ngo</p>
            <p> Apr 2023 - Present</p>
            <p>
              For my masters project, I am investigating design elements which prompt social media users to add alternative text (alt text), descriptions of their images,
              to their posts. Many images on social media lack alt text, which makes navigating these sites more difficult for blind and low vision users.
              Our work focuses on encouraging social media posters to add alt text to their images, decreasing this barrier.
              To investigate how user interface design elements influence social media users to change their behavior, 
              we are developing several different versions of an iPhone app which integrates different design elements. We will run a longitudinal user study to assess
              the impact of these behavior change design elements.

            <h3>Including Accessibility In Computer Science</h3>
            <p> Project Leads: Dr. Yasmine Elglaly, Dr. Catherine Baker, Dr. Kristen Shinohara and Dr. Anne Spencer Ross</p>
              <p>Project Teammates: Emily Kuang, Kripa Kundaliya, Abigayle Peterson, Jadyn Barrett </p>
             <p> Apr 2023 - Present</p>
            <p> 
              This project is focused on determining the efficacy of assignments which intigrate accessibiity-focused learning objectives into core computer science assignments. 
              Accessibility knowledge is an important skill for designing digital technology to be accessible to all;
              however, it is often introduced in elective courses later, such as Accessible Computing. 
              The goal of these assignments is to introduce computer science students to accessibility concepts earlier in their computer science education, 
              while still maintaining the original goals of the assignments. </p>
            <p>
              Previously, we conducted qualitative analysis on instructor and student data interviews conducted via a user study where our assignments were 
              tested in computer science classes in undergraduate and community college courses, and co-authored a paper based on our findings. 
              I am currently collaborating on the development of a white paper to advise computer science instructors on how to integrate accessibility knowledge into their curriculum.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Exploring Methods of Collecting Accessibility Feedback</h3>
            <p>Project Advisor: Dr. Yasmine Elglaly</p>
             <p> Mar 2022 - Jun 2022</p>
            <p> 
              For my Undergraduate Honors Capstone Project, I designed and executed a research study interviewing software developers and designers about 
              how they collect accessibility feedback on their software. The purpose of the study was to determine current practices, as well as areas where current systems were lacking.
              For this project, I conducted interviews, analyzed the qualitative data, and presented my findings at the Honors Capstone Symposia. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Website Accessibility Collection Tool</h3>
            <p> Project Advisors: Dr. Yasmine Elglaly, Dr. Brian Hutchinson, Dr. Dustin O'Hara, David Engebretson, and David Bass</p>
            <p> Project Teammates: Dani Sprague, Nick Harang, Robin Balatbat, and Hazel Metcalf</p>
             <p> Sep 2021 - Jun 2022</p>
            
            <p>
              For my undergraduate computer science senior project, we developed a data collection browser plugin to gather website accessibility data from people with disabilities.
              My work focused on the backend of the tool, involving work with Docker, Oracle VM VirtualBox, and Flask.
